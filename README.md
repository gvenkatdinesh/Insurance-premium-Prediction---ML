# Insurance-premium-Prediction---ML

Tools Used: I used Python for building a Machine Learning Model to determine the annual insurance premium (amount paid every month) offered to the customers.

👩🏻‍💻 Work Process:

Explore the data and find correlations between inputs and targets
Pick the right model, loss functions and optimizer for the problem at hand
Scale numeric variables and one-hot encode categorical data
Set aside a test set (using a fraction of the training set)
Train the model using Linear Regression
Make predictions on the test set and compute the loss
